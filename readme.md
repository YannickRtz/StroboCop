# StroboCop

Too many DJs with too many screens? Get you party in shape and your screens in sync! StroboCop will use all your screens to display “light shows” of varying sophistication, but constant greatness.

Prime directive: party on, dudes.

## Installation
At this stage StroboCop still needs Processing 2 installed. Compile and run with Processing GUI or processing-java command line application. On OS X it needs the following system preference turned off (under Mission Control): "Displays have separate spaces."
