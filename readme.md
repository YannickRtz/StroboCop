# StroboCop

Too many DJs with too many screens? Get your party in shape and your screens in sync! StroboCop will use all your screens to display “light shows” of varying sophistication, but constant greatness.

## Usage

StroboCop is still early in development. There are still a few uncool things happening:

* At this stage StroboCop still needs Processing 2 installed. Compile and run with Processing GUI or processing-java command line application.
* On OS X it needs the following system preference turned off (under Mission Control): "Displays have separate spaces."
* Preferences are still hardcoded and need to be adjusted for the program to run.
* All displays need to be set to the same resolution as the main display of the machine they are connected to.
* ...and possibly a thousand other things we have not tested yet.
